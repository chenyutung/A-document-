  <h1>CRYPTO ART</h1>

  <p>
    The biggest drivers of the crypto art landscape are the artists that create/recreate pieces to be stored over the blockchain. Although NFTs can represent numerous aspects of the digital world, the first step begins with the creation of digital artwork. Digital art can be created by using readily-available software and a personal computer in the form of GIF, JPEG, videos, 3D images and similar art forms.
    
    While the aforementioned digital art can be easily replicated and distributed over the internet, crypto artists need to certify and mint a nonfungible token that is linked to the authenticity of the art created. Once certified, the art can then be uploaded to various marketplaces and marketed to potential buyers. 
    
    It is important to note that crypto art is also subject to copyright laws and artists are expected to create, mint and sell unique NFTs while respecting the ownership of other artworks.
    <br>
    <span class="smallt">Can crypto art be copied?</span>
    <br>
    Contrasting to the popular belief that replicating crypto art is as simple as saving a copy of the image or video locally on a computing device, copying crypto art is technically impossible. For example, when a user attempts to “save” a crypto art, the person ends up saving an identical copy of the image but misses out on capturing the information that makes the NFT component of any digital art. 
    
    In many cases, the artist may choose to retain the copyright ownership of an NFT, which allows the artist to create and sell multiple copies of the same art. However, the metadata helps differentiate the ownership of similar-looking NFTs and ensures the credibility of the creator.
    
    As discussed earlier, crypto art (just like any other form of art) is subject to copyright and wrongly claiming to be the creator can have negative consequences depending on the law of the land.

  <span class="smallt">Style</span>
  <br>
  <p>Pak is known for a style that takes advantage of blockchain technology, specifically its smart contracts, described as an appeal to cryptocurrency fans. The images associated with Pak's NFTs use geometric shapes or programmatically generated images. Pak frequently embeds hidden messages into NFTs, and uses social media platforms in a candid way to promote and discuss them. Pak's use of NFTs has been described as challenging the concepts of value and ownership.</p>

  <h2>Paul Otlet: Objects as Documents</h2>

  <p>Otlet extended the definition of “document” halfway through his Traité de documentation of 1934. Graphic and written records are representations of ideas or of objects, he wrote, but the objects themselves can be regarded as “documents” if you are informed by observation of them. As examples of such “documents,” Otlet cites natural objects, artifacts, objects bearing traces of human activity (such as archaeological finds), explanatory models, educational games, and works of art.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

  <p>In 1935, Walter Schürmeyer wrote: “Nowadays one understands as a document any material basis for extending our knowledge which is available for study or comparison”.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Similarly, the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation, an agency of the League of Nations, developed, in collaboration with Union Français des Organismes de Documentation, technical definitions of “document” and related technical terms in English, French, and German versions and adopted:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Document:
      <ul>
        <li>Toute base de connaissance, fixée matériellement, susceptible d’être utilisée pour consultation, étude ou preuve. Exemples: manuscrits, imprimés, représentations graphiques ou figurés, objets de collections, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Document:
      <ul>
        <li>Any source of information, in material form, capable of being used for reference or study or as an authority. Examples: manuscripts, printed matter, illustrations, diagrams, museum specimens, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dokument:
      <ul>
        <li>Dokument is jeder Gegenstand, der zur Belehrung, zum Studium oder sur Beweisführung dienen kann, z.B. Handschriften, Drucke, graphische oder bildliche Darstellungen, usw.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Suzanne Briet: Physical Evidence as Document</h2>

  <p>One individual, who had, for years, been involved in discussions of the nature of documentation and documents, addressed the extension of the meaning of “document” with unusual directness. Suzanne Briet (1894–1989), also known as Suzanne Dupuy and as Suzanne Dupuy-Briet, was active as a librarian and documentalist from 1924 to 1954.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

  <p>In 1951, Briet published a manifesto on the nature of documentation, <em>Qu’est-ce que la documentation</em>, which starts with the assertion that “A document is evidence in support of a fact”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> She then elaborates: A document is “any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct, or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. The implication is that documentation should not be viewed as being concerned with texts but with access to evidence.</p>

  <h3>The Antelope as Document</h3>

  <p>Briet<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> enumerates six objects and asks if each is a document.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>

        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stone in museum</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Animal in wild</td>
        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Animal in zoo</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>There is discussion of an antelope. An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document, she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Not only that, but scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

  <p>Briet’s rules for determining when an object has become a document are not made clear. We infer, however, from her discussion that:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>There is materiality: Physical objects and physical signs only;</li>
    <li>There is intentionality: It is intended that the object be treated as evidence;</li>
    <li>The objects have to be processed: They have to be made into documents; and, we think,</li>
    <li>There is a phenomenological position: The object is perceived to be a document.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This situation is reminiscent of discussions of how an image is made art by framing it as art. Did Briet mean that just as “art” is made art by “framing” (i.e., treating) it as art, so an object becomes a “document” when it is treated as a document, i.e., as a physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct, or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon? The sources of these views are not made clear, though she does mention, in this context, her friend Raymond Bayer, a professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne, who specialized in aesthetics and phenomenology.</p>

  <p>Ron Day<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> has suggested, very plausibly, that Briet’s use of the word “indice” is important, that it is indexicality—the quality of having been placed in an organized, meaningful relationship with other evidence—that gives an object its documentary status.</p>

  <h2>Donker Duyvis: A Spiritual Dimension to Documents</h2>

  <p>Frits Donker Duyvis (1894–1961), who succeeded Paul Otlet as the central figure in the International Federation for Documentation, epitomized the modernist mentality of the documentalists in his dedication to the trinity of scientific management, standardization, and bibliographic control as complementary and mutually reinforcing bases for achieving progress.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Yet Donker Duyvis was not a materialist. He adopted Otlet’s view that a document was an expression of human thought, but he did so in terms of his interest in the work of Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), founder of Anthroposophy, a spiritual movement based on the notion that there is a spiritual world comprehensible to pure thought and accessible only to the highest faculties of mental knowledge. As a result, Donker Duyvis was sensitive to what we might now call the cognitive aspects of the medium of the message. He wrote that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A document is the repository of an expressed thought. Consequently its contents have a spiritual character. The danger that blunt unification of the outer form exercises a repercussion on the contents in making the latter characterless and impersonal, is not illusory. . . . In standardizing the form and layout of documents it is necessary to restrict this activity to that which does not affect the spiritual contents and which serves to remove a really irrational variety.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Ranganathan: Micro-Thought on a Flat Surface</h2>

  <p>The Indian theorist S.R. Ranganathan, usually so metaphysical, took a curiously narrow and pragmatic position on the definition of “document,” resisting even the inclusion of audiovisual materials such as radio and television communications.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>But they are not documents; because they are not records on materials fit for handling or preservation. Statues, pieces of china, and the material exhibits in a museum were mentioned because they convey thought expressed in some way. But none of these is a document, since it is not a record on a more or less flat surface.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ranganathan’s view of “document” as a synonym for “embodied micro thought” on paper “or other material, fit for physical handling, transport across space, and preservation through time” was adopted by the Indian Standards Institute (1963, p. 24), with a note explaining that the term “document” is now extended in use to include any embodied thought, micro or macro and whether the physical embodiment is exclusive to one work or is shared by more than one work.”</p>

  <p>Others, also, took a limited view of what documents were. In the U.S.A., two highly influential authors opted for a view of documents that was only an extension of textual records to include audiovisual communications. Louis Shores popularized the phrase “the generic book”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and Jesse H. Shera used “the graphic record” with much the same meaning.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Shera was gratuitously dismissive of Briet’s notion of documents as evidence.</p>

  <h2>Anthropology: Material Culture</h2>

  <p>Otlet was explicit that his view of “document” included archaeological finds, traces of human activity, and other objects not intended as communication.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Collections of objects brought together for purposes of preservation, science and education are essentially documentary in character (Museums and Cabinets, collections of models, specimens and samples). These collections are created from items occurring in nature rather than being delineated or described in words; they are three dimensional documents.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The notion of objects as documents resembles the notion of “material culture” among cultural anthropologists “for whom artifacts contributed important evidence in the documentation and interpretation of the American experience” (Ames et al., 1985, p. ix) and in museology.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>

  <h2>Semiotics: “Text” and “Object-as-Sign”</h2>

  <p>Briet’s ideas concerning the nature of a “document” invite discussion in relation to semiotics. In this context, we note Dufrenne’s discussion of the distinction between aesthetic objects and signifying objects:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The function of such [signifying] objects is not to subserve some action or to satisfy some need but to dispense knowledge. We can, of course, call all objects signifying in some sense. However, we must single out those objects which do more than signify merely in order to prepare us for some action and which are not used up merely in the fulfillment of the task. Scientific texts, catechisms, photograph albums, and, on a more modest scale, signposts are all signs whose signification engages us in an activity only after having first furnished us with information.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We can observe that by the inclusion of museum and other “found” objects, Briet’s “any physical or symbolic sign” appears to include both human signs and natural signs. Others developed the notion of “object-as-sign.” Roland Barthes, for example, in discussing “the semantics of the object,” wrote that objects</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>function as the vehicle of meaning: in other words, the object effectively serves some purpose, but it also serves to communicate information: we might sum it up by saying that there is always a meaning which overflows the object’s use.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We can note the widespread use of the word “text” to characterize patterns of social phenomena not made of words or numerals, but there seems to have been relatively little attention to the overlap between semiotics and information science.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

  <h2>Comments</h2>

  <p>One difference between the views of the documentalists discussed above and contemporary views is the emphasis that would now be placed on the social construction of meaning, on the viewer’s perception of the significance and evidential character of documents. “Relevance,” a central concept in information retrieval studies, is now generally considered to be situational and ascribed by the viewer. In semiotic terminology,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>signs are never natural objects. . . . The reason is simply that the property of being a sign is not a natural property that can be searched for and found, but a property that is given to objects, be they natural or artificial, through the kind of use that is made of them. Both as objects and as means, signs have to be treated as something invented, and in this sense they are correlated to actions.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Briet’s notion of documents as evidence can occur in at least two ways. One purpose of information systems is to store and maintain access to whatever evidence has been cited as evidence of some assertion. Another approach is for the person in a position to organize artifacts, samples, specimens, texts, or other objects to consider what each could tell one about the world that produced it, and then, having developed some theory of its significance to place the object <em>in evidence</em>, to offer it as evidence by the way it is arranged, indexed, or presented. In this manner, information systems can be used not only in finding material that already is in evidence, but also in arranging material so that someone may be able to make use of it as (new) evidence for some purpose.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

  <p>The evolving notion of “document” among Otlet, Briet, Schurmeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. Levy’s thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, but so does everything else in a digital environment. In this sense, any distinctiveness of a document as a physical form is further diminished, and discussion of “What is a digital document?” becomes even more problematic unless we remember the path of reasoning underlying the largely forgotten discussions of Otlet’s objects and Briet’s antelope.</p>

  <h2>Postscript: Documenting the Antelope</h2>

  <p>Briet’s discussion of an antelope as a document is quite specific: The antelope was from Africa; it was a newly discovered species; and it was brought to the Jardin des Plantes of the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Her account reads as if she were referring to an actual antelope known to her. In 1947, not long before Briet’s book appeared, the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle did announce the discovery of a new African antelope—<em>Tragelaphus scriptus reidae</em>, a subspecies of bushbuck — but there is no indication that a specimen was taken to Paris.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The documentation of antelopes reveals that very few new species were discovered during Briet’s lifetime and documentary evidence of Briet’s antelope has eluded us. Appropriately, the word “antelope” itself, we found, is thought by some to derive from the Ethiopian word for the elusive unicorn.</p>
